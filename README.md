### Exploration notebook
##### Visualize audio file
'y' is a table containing the amplitude values ​​of the sound (sound wave).
'sr' (sample rate) is the number of samples per second, which indicates how often the values ​​are measured.

Spectrogram: 3D representation (time, frequency, intensity) that shows how the energy (amplitude) of the signal is distributed across different frequencies over time.

##### Extract audio features
MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are popular features in sound analysis and music recognition. They capture the spectral envelope of sound, which makes them useful for modeling musical timbres and vocal sounds.

Chroma characteristics represent the intensity of different pitches (notes) in the chromatic scale (12 notes). This can be useful for capturing harmony and tone.
